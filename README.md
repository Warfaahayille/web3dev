# Simple Ethereum Portfolio Tracker
This project aims to create a basic decentralized application (dApp) on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to track their Ethereum-based assets. The dApp will integrate with user-connected wallets (e.g., MetaMask) to display balances of ETH, ERC-20 tokens, and ERC-721 NFTs. It will fetch real-time price data from external APIs to provide an estimated portfolio value in a chosen fiat currency. This project focuses on core Web3 interactions, basic smart contract usage for potential future extensions, and frontend development with a user-friendly interface.

## Key Features:

- Wallet connection (MetaMask integration)
- Display of ETH, ERC-20 token, and ERC-721 NFT balances
- Real-time price fetching and portfolio valuation
- Simple and intuitive user interface
